# HackBU2023 - ChatBot Project
-Project members: Parjan Ameen, Nicholas Cirello, Jiyun Park, Charles Enders

-Overview: Our program uses a GUI to allow the user to enter text into a prompt 
which is then echoed onto the chat screen along with a Bots response. The Bots response comes from a trained nltk 
database. The GUI also has buttons on the side of the screen which allows the user to communicate
with a dog and cat.
