# HackBU2023 - Bot Hub Project
-Project members: Parjan Ameen, Nicholas Cirello, Jiyun Park, Charles Enders

- Overview: Our program uses a GUI to allow the user to enter text into a prompt 
which is then echoed onto the chat screen along with a Bots response. The Bots response comes from a trained nltk 
combined with the .json file. The GUI also has buttons on the side of the screen which allows the user to communicate
with a dog, and a cat.

- We also have two other bots which are the meal plan bot and the dictionary bot. 

- The meal plan bot asks for a username and a password for your binghamton meal plan account. Then it automatically logins for      you, and calculates how much money you can spend a day depending on how many days are left in the semester.

- The dictionary bot with allow an the user to insert a defined word and output the defintion of that word after scrapping the web for the word.

- To run the program the user might have to run "download.py" in order to confirm they have to correct packages install. After that you can run "botHub.py".
